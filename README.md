# Codex Shared Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for Codex-enabled repositories. These workflows live in their own repository so multiple projects can invoke them via `workflow_call` while centralizing prompts, scripts, and configuration.

## Workflows

- `.github/workflows/codex-review.yml`  
  Runs a Codex-powered pull request review. It collects PR context, executes `activadee/codex-action`, normalizes the output, and updates a sticky summary comment with the latest findings checklist.

- `.github/workflows/go-tests.yml`  
  Installs Go, caches dependencies, and executes `go test` with configurable flags.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`  
  Generates release notes with Codex and publishes a GitHub release, optionally running `go test` first.

- `.github/workflows/auto-label.yml`  
  Calls Codex to suggest up to three labels for new or updated issues, creating labels when needed.

- `.github/workflows/doc-sync.yml`  
  Invokes Codex on pull requests to review the current diff, edit the necessary documentation files, and push a `[skip ci][skip github-actions]` commit directly from the workflow (no follow-up jobs needed). Network access stays enabled inside the sandbox because the workflow passes `--config sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true` through `codex-args`, so Codex can reach web search or `gh` without falling back to `danger-full-access`.

- `.github/workflows/issue-plan.yml`  
  Reads an issue plus repository context on `main`, has Codex (GPT-5.1-codex / high effort with network access) draft an implementation plan, and posts that plan back to the issue via the GitHub CLI using the forwarded `GH_TOKEN`.

## Using the workflows

Create a workflow in another repository and reference the desired file via `uses`. Pin to a tag or commit once published.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
name: PR Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  codex-review:
    uses: activadee/codex-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/codex-review.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      prompt_extra: |
        Prioritize security regressions and user-facing bugs.

  auto-label:
    uses: activadee/codex-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/auto-label.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      max_labels: 3
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  go-tests:
    uses: activadee/codex-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/go-tests.yml@v1
    with:
      go_version_file: go.mod
      test_flags: ./... -race -count=1

  release:
    uses: activadee/codex-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      tag_name: v0.2.0
      target: main
      release_title: Codex SDK v0.2.0
      draft: false
```

### Secrets

Reusable workflows cannot access secrets from the workflow repository. Define required secrets in each calling repository (or at the organization/environment level) and forward them with `secrets: inherit` or explicit mappings.

Required secrets for `codex-review.yml`:

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` – Base64-encoded Codex `auth.json` (from ChatGPT subscription auth). The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available automatically.

Required secrets for `release.yml`:

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` – Shared Codex credentials for generating release notes.

Required secrets for `auto-label.yml`:

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` – Codex credentials for label generation.

Required secrets for `doc-sync.yml`:

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` – Codex credentials used to generate documentation updates.

Required secrets for `issue-plan.yml`:

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` – Codex credentials for drafting the implementation plan (the workflow also relies on the caller-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` to read and comment on issues).

## Refactor roadmap

- **Phase 0 (current):** establish automation-hub scaffolding directories and centralize prompts under `prompts/` so downstream assets can consume them without cloning `.github/prompts`. Track work in `plan.md`.
- **Upcoming phases:** migrate each workflow into modular composites, add workflow templates + CLI surface, expand docs/tests, and cut a `v1.0.0` release once all assets live in the new layout.

## Development

1. Duplicate the workflows into a feature branch and modify as needed.
2. Use a sandbox repository to consume the branch ref (`@feature-branch`) and verify behavior.
3. Once validated, tag a release (e.g., `v1.0.0`) so downstream repos can pin to an immutable reference.

## Limitations

- GitHub does not allow reusable workflows to access secrets or protected variables defined in this repository. Consumers must define required secrets themselves or inherit them from an organization/environment.
- The review workflow assumes a pull request event; if invoked from other events, required context such as `github.event.pull_request` is missing and the workflow will exit early.
