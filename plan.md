# Codex Automation Hub Refactor Plan

## Objectives
- Replace this monolithic "shared workflows" repository with a modular automation hub that exposes:
  - Versioned composite/container actions for small reusable units.
  - Thin reusable workflows that orchestrate those actions.
  - Workflow templates for repos that need to vendor YAML instead of using `workflow_call`.
  - A Codex CLI / `gh codex` extension that mirrors automation behavior locally and can trigger the workflows.
- Preserve feature parity for every existing workflow while setting up a foundation for future tasks (new jobs, prompts, Codex features).
- Reduce duplicated checkout/prompt/script logic by moving it into common actions/libraries.
- Provide auditability (tests, docs) so downstream teams can trust tagged releases.

## Cross-cutting Refactor Tasks
1. **Common utilities.** Extract repeated checkout/prompt/artifact logic into `actions/common/*` composites so each workflow can reference `uses: ./actions/common/...`. Provide Node helpers under `pkg/` (or `cli/internal/`) and share them between actions and the CLI.
2. **CLI + shared prompts.** Move prompts/schemas from `.github/prompts/*` to `prompts/` at the repo root. Wrap them in the CLI so developers can run `codex review --local` before pushing. Ensure CLI reuses the same actions package via a shared `pkg/codex` module.
3. **Testing + linting.** Add `tests/actions/<workflow>.yml` to run `actionlint`, smoke-run composites via `act`, and unit-test CLI commands. Hook these tests into `.github/workflows/test-actions.yml` and `lint-cli.yml`.
4. **Versioning + releases.** Define semantic tags for actions (`v1`, `v1.1.0`), workflows, and CLI releases. Document promotion steps in `docs/releasing.md`.
5. **Migration guides.** For every workflow, ship a doc with: feature parity matrix, migration instructions (replace `activadee/codex-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/foo.yml@main` with `org/codex-automation-hub/.github/workflows/foo.yml@v1`), and CLI equivalents.

## Workflow-specific Plans

### 1. `codex-review.yml`
**Current state.** Single workflow job orchestrates checkout, custom composite (`codex-collect`), prompt concatenation, schema loading, Codex run, JS normalization, and submission. Shared scripts live under `.github/scripts/codex/*` but require checking out this repository inside the consumer repo.

**Target architecture.**
- Composite action stack under `actions/codex-review`:
  1. `collect-context` – wraps `codex-collect` logic without requiring callers to clone this repo. Publishes diff metadata, changed files, and caches JSON artifacts to `$RUNNER_TEMP`.
  2. `prepare-prompt` – copies prompt template, appends `prompt_extra`, resolves schema, and outputs pointer paths.
  3. `run-review` – thin wrapper around `activadee/codex-action` with strongly typed inputs (safety, model, effort, args) and built-in retry/backoff for transient Codex issues.
  4. `submit-review` – replaces the `actions/github-script`/Node script combo with either a compiled CLI subcommand or a TypeScript action that posts inline review comments and summary.
- Reusable workflow becomes a one-job orchestrator that just calls the new composites plus uploads failure artifacts.
- CLI command `codex review` mirrors the same pipeline: collects context locally, generates prompt, runs Codex via CLI, and displays/opens a diff.

**Implementation steps.**
1. Port `.github/actions/codex-collect`, `scripts/codex/*.js`, and prompt logic into `actions/codex-review/*`. Replace Node scripts with TypeScript packaged via `@actions/core` (transpiled to `dist/`).
2. Introduce `actions/common/checkout-target` (takes ref/SHA, fetch-depth, optional sparse) and `actions/common/checkout-shared-assets` (clones this repo only when necessary). Update the workflow to depend on these composites.
3. Update `codex-review.yml` to call composites sequentially. Remove inline shell prompt concatenation; rely on outputs from `prepare-prompt`.
4. Add `workflows/codex-review.yml` tests using `act` to simulate PR inputs; ensure failure artifacts upload path matches new names.
5. Document CLI equivalence and fallback instructions in `docs/workflows/codex-review.md`.
6. Release `v1.0.0` tag that includes the modularized workflow + composites.

### 2. `go-tests.yml`
**Current state.** (pre-refactor) Single job: checkout, `actions/setup-go`, optional inline pre-test script, and `go test`. No structured caching toggles, coverage upload, or composable actions.

**Refactor status.** Completed in branch `feature/phase0-bootstrap`:
- Added Go-specific composites (`actions/go/setup`, `actions/go/pre-test`, `actions/go/test`) that install Go, run optional setup scripts, and execute `go test` with race + coverage support.
- Updated `go-tests.yml` to consume those composites, expose new inputs (`cache_dependency_path`, `coverage_profile`, `upload_coverage_artifact`, `race`), and optionally upload coverage artifacts via `actions/upload-artifact`.
  - Coverage details bubble up through outputs (`steps.run_tests.outputs.coverage_profile*`) for downstream jobs.
- Workflow now checks out the shared automation repo (temporary until the hub is standalone) to access the new actions.

**Follow-ups (Phase 1 Step 3).**
1. Document the new inputs/composites in README + dedicated `docs/workflows/go-tests.md`. ✅
2. Track next tasks: add `docs/actions/go.md` (still todo) and create `tests/actions/go-tests.yml` for actionlint/`act` coverage (todo).

### 3. `release.yml`
**Status.** Refactor merged on `feature/phase0-bootstrap`:
- Added `actions/release/{determine-range,prepare-prompt,generate-highlights,render-notes}` to encapsulate tag discovery, prompt generation, Codex invocation, and Markdown rendering.
- Workflow now reuses Go composites for pre-release tests (coverage, race, artifacts) and exposes Codex overrides (`prompt_extra`, `codex_model`, etc.).
- Release notes are surfaced via the composite outputs (`steps.render_notes.outputs.notes`) and written to `release-notes.md`.

**Follow-ups.**
1. Document composites in `docs/actions/release.md` (todo) and keep `docs/workflows/release.md` updated (initial version added in Phase 2, Step 3).
2. Add `tests/actions/release.yml` (future Phase 3) that runs `actionlint` + an `act` dry run with synthetic tags/commits.
3. Explore providing a workflow template (`workflow-templates/release-template.yml`) once CLI integration is ready.

### 4. `auto-label.yml`
**Status.** Refactor complete:
- Introduced `actions/auto-label/{prepare,run,apply}` composites (legacy `.github/actions/*` now delegate to them).
- Workflow exposes configurable Codex parameters and an option to disable creation of new labels; it also publishes outputs listing the applied labels.

**Follow-ups.**
1. Add advanced filtering (`allowlist`/`blocklist`) and dry-run previews to the apply step before rolling out CLI parity.
2. Create `tests/actions/auto-label.yml` to smoke-test the workflow via `act`.

### 5. `codex-doc-sync.yml`
**Status.** Refactor complete:
- Scripts now live under `actions/doc-sync/lib` and power the new composites (`context`, `prepare`, `build-prompt`, `edit`, `push`). Legacy `.github/actions/doc-sync-*` delegate to the new versions.
- Workflow references the new composites (`./__codex_shared/actions/doc-sync/*`), uses the latest template path, and keeps branch pinning via `github.action_ref`.
- Documentation scope + commit summary logic stays the same but is easier to consume elsewhere; future CLI work can call these composites directly.

**Follow-ups.**
1. Add dry-run support / manifest outputs before enabling CLI parity.
2. Author `tests/actions/doc-sync.yml` for `actionlint` + `act` smoke testing once fixtures exist.

## Migration Strategy & Timeline
1. **Phase 0 – Bootstrap (Weeks 1-2).**
   - Clone existing repo into `codex-automation-hub` inside org.
   - Set up scaffolding directories (`actions`, `workflows`, `workflow-templates`, `cli`, `docs`).
   - Copy prompts/schemas into `prompts/`; update references.
2. **Phase 1 – Common foundation (Weeks 2-3).**
   - Implement `actions/common/*` and update `codex-review` workflow as pilot.
   - Release `codex-review` v0 beta tag and validate with internal repo.
3. **Phase 2 – Rework remaining workflows (Weeks 3-5).**
   - Tackle `go-tests` and `release` (simpler) first.
   - Follow with `auto-label` and `codex-doc-sync` once shared libraries are stable.
4. **Phase 3 – CLI + templates (Weeks 5-6).**
   - Implement CLI commands using shared libraries.
   - Publish workflow templates + migration docs.
5. **Phase 4 – Adoption (Weeks 6+).**
   - Open PRs in consuming repos switching to new tags.
   - Deprecate `activadee/codex-shared-workflows` once adoption >90%.

## Phase Tracking

- [x] **Phase 0 – Bootstrap:** scaffolding directories created, prompts relocated, roadmap captured (commit `feature/phase0-bootstrap`).
- [ ] **Phase 1 – Common foundation:**
  - [x] Create `actions/common/*` and `actions/codex-review/*` scaffolding; migrate review scripts into `actions/codex-review/lib/`.
  - [x] Update `codex-review.yml` to consume the new composites (still using local checkout until remote pinning strategy is finalized).
  - [ ] Publish guidance/tests ensuring the new composites work under `workflow_call` consumers.
- [ ] **Phase 2 – Rework remaining workflows**
  - [x] Modularize `go-tests.yml` (actions/go, docs/workflows/go-tests.md, README/plan updates); `act` tests intentionally skipped for now.
  - [x] Modularize `release.yml` (actions/release, docs/workflows/release.md, README/plan updates); `act` tests intentionally skipped for now.
  - [x] Refactor `auto-label.yml` (actions/auto-label, docs/workflows/auto-label.md); extra filtering + tests deferred.
  - [x] Refactor `codex-doc-sync.yml` (actions/doc-sync, docs/workflows/codex-doc-sync.md); dry-run/tests deferred.
- [ ] **Phase 3 – CLI + templates**
- [ ] **Phase 4 – Adoption / deprecation**
